This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a .env.development.local file and add environment variables:

- PRODUCT_SEARCH_API_URL - fully qualified URL to the VP search API (e.g. "https://api.example.com?apiKey=foo")
- IMAGES_SRC_URL - domain name for images to be sourced in the product search (e.g. "images.cdn.example.com")

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

The app will start running on port 3000
